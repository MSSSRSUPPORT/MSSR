# Installation guide

Prior to MSSR installation, the latest version of FIJI must be running on your computer (https://fiji.sc/). Additionally, the CLIJ, CLIJ2 and CLIJx packages (https://clij.github.io/clij2-docs/installationInFiji) must be installed (Figure panel c).
Plugin installation of MSSR can occur in two alternative ways:
1. Through the installation option in FIJI (Plugins -> Install -> MSSR_X.X.X.jar) (Figure panel c).
2. By directly placing the MSSR_X.X.X.jar file in the specific FIJI plugins folder in your system (Figure panel b).

# MSSR Plugin

Two options are available within the MSSR plugin (Figure panel a):

* MSSR Analysis - Encompasses the major processing steps for either 𝑠𝑓−𝑀𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑛or 𝑡−𝑀𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑛.

* Temporal Analysis - Allows the user to perform an additional temporal analysis by selecting a desired PTF for 𝑡−𝑀𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑛 processing.

In what follows the main parameters available for MSSR analysis computation will be explained, hence, description will be centered on the use of the MSSR Analysis tab of the MSSR plugin.

Three parameters are needed for MSSR analysis (Figure panel b.1):

* AMP – An upscaling factor for the resulting MSSR image size.

* FWHM – The number of pixels that cover the Full Width at Half Maximum of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the imaging lens.

* Order – The number of MSSR iterations for the image resolution enhancement.

The plugin offers the option of computing 𝑠𝑓−𝑀𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑛, or both 𝑠𝑓−𝑀𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑛 and 𝑡−𝑀𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑛. The temporal analysis is enabled when selecting the option “MSSR Temporal analysis” (Figure panel b.3) where the user can choose one of five available PTFs: Mean, Variance (Var), Temporal Product Mean (TPM), Coefficient Variation, Auto-cumulant Function of order 2-4 (SOFI 2-4).

Additional features:

* Computation of FWHM – provides an estimation of the imaging system’s Rayleigh criterion based on known optical parameters (Figure panel c).

* Interpolation type – allows you to select between two types of interpolation to magnify the image. The default option for this parameter is ‘Bicubic’.

* Minimize Meshing – Enable the mesh minimization algorithm which minimizes a ‘mesh’ pattern that commonly appears during the analysis as result of using a bicubic interpolation algorithm for digital upscaling (Figure panel b.2). The default option for this parameter is active.

* GPU Computing – Enables GPU usage for computing for MSSR processing (Figure panel b.2).

* Intensity Normalization – Allow a pixel-wise multiplication with the MSSR image (scaled from 0 to 1 in pixel values) with the magnified original image (Figure panel b.2).

* Selecting Image– Select a desired image or image stack for MSSR processing from the images which are already loaded in FIJI/ImageJ (Figure panel b.3).

* Batch Analysis – Allow to automatically analyze all the images within a selected folder in the user’s computer (Figure panel b.3).

# Instructions for use

1. Open ImageJ

2. Open the dataset *test_image.tif*.

3. Go to Plugins -> MSSR -> MSSR Analysis
A window will open.

4. Define the parameters, and additional features.

5. Click on "OK" button.

6. After a few seconds (depending on the specifications of your computer, the defined parameters and the data to be analyzed it might take longer), one or two images will appear (two if a temporal analysis is selected).

-------------------
# Demo

Open the image of interest in ImageJ and make sure it is the active window.

The plugin supports multidimensional stacks of any bit depth (The resulting images will be 32-bit).

Define the three main parameters. Select additional features at your convenience.
Selection a temporal analysis will generate two images, one for the processed stack and other por the temporal stack projection.
